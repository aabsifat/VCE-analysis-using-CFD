Vapor Cloud Explosion analysis using Computational Fluid Dynamics
This project was the result of my master's final work. 
We used FLACS CFD simulation software by Genxcon.
The project mainly focused on studying the spread of flammable vapor cloud and finding ways to mitigate exlosion or fire in Oil Refinery.
